						<span>My name is david and I love to program. I'm a student at the University of Chicago where I study computer science and psychology. I hope to one day apply these two passions of mine to the world through the code that I write. I'm always looking to learn something new about programming, and always interested in the cool project that you are (probably) working on. Currently, I am spending most of my time learning about machine learning and trying to contribute to some of the open source libraries and websites that I use most often.<span>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span>One of my other greatest passions is being outdoors. Whether its camping, hiking, sailing, or any other form of adventuring I'm always game. One of my favorite hidden gems is Northwern Wisconsin and Lake Superior, known of course by many Midwesterns, but by very few outside of that part of the United States. The California coast is another beautiful part of the country, home to some of the most breathtaking landscapes I've ever been in. There are still many places I want to go and things I want to see, and my list is ever-growing. I have recently knocked skydiving off my bucket list, who knows whats next!</span>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span>I like to spend my free time indulging my creative side, whether its working on a project or over a stove in the kitchen. I love to cook and I defintely think that has both influenced and been influenced by my growing love for coding. I like to think of myself as an equal parts front-end and back-end developer, but I often enjoy the freedoms you can employ when designing and implementing an interface. I'd love to talk with you about your thoughts on any of this, so please don't hesitate to shoot me an email.</span>

							<span>Pirate Panic - </span>
						</div>
						<div class="proj-desc proj">
							<span>A game that I worked on with some classmates for my Video Game Design CMSC 23800 class. It is a racing game in which you raced other ships as a merchant while also trying to evade the pirate. It has functioning AI (using the A* Search algorithm) and procedural terrain generation.The game was written in C++ using the OGRE graphics engine and boost. It was a ton of fun to work on, <a href="https://github.com/VjiaoBlack/codename-ted" target="_blank">you can check out the code here.</a></span>

						<div class="proj-desc proj">
							<span>My project for YHack 2016 that visualizes financial data in real time with the LEDs on a corsair keyboard. It uses Intuit's mint API, chart.js, Corsair's cue-sdk, and flask. You can check out our entry <a href="https://devpost.com/software/asdfinance" target="_blank">here on devpost</a> or <a href="https://github.com/darrentu/asdfinance" target="_blank">here on github.</a></span>

						<div class="proj-desc proj">
							<span>My Project for Hack Harvard 2015 that incorporates basic machine learning and customer interaction. The App used Yelp's IOS API and would suggest restaurants to you based on a series of answers you gave it. Eventually, it would learn your preferences and suggest a restuarant to you upon opening the app. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/foodme-dwt1p0" target="_blank">You can check out the devpost on the project here.</a></span>

						<div class="proj-desc proj">
							<span>An fully-integrated display system for my high school's schedule, personalized to each student's schedule. I worked on the backend code and developed the CMS for administration of all of the application's resources. I primarily worked with RedBeanPHP and the PHP formatting engine Twig.

							<span>HW Chronicle - </span>
						</div>
						<div class="proj-desc proj">
							<span>I was the webmaster and designer for my school newspaper's website for two years. I added many features, like an interactive social media panel and an improved search algorithm. I also designed and created interactive, online articles for our special features. One my my most memorable experiences from this project was taking back control over our Wordpress site from an india-based script bot. I was still very new to web development and the website had no formal source control. It was a great learning experience and makes a great story to this day. Unfortunatly, the site I worked on is no longer live, but <a href="https://github.com/Harvard-WestlakeChronicle/TheChronicle/tree/hwchronicle_secure" target="_blank">you can still check out the source code here.</a></span>

						</div>
						<div class="proj-desc proj">
							<span>One of my earliest projects from high school, where I led programming workshops with a friend for younger, mostly under-privileged children. We primarrily taught scratch and html basics but also had some cool workshops with 3D modeling and printing, as well some in robotics and basic javascript games. I made the website for the workshops <a href="http://k4k.dwold.com/about" target="_blank">which you can check out here.</a></span>

							<span>I've worked on many websites over the years, most of them simply for fun. My old personal website <a href="/old.html" target="_blank">can be found here.</a> This website is my most recent project, and I hope to work on more standalone pages like this soon. I'm working on a web application with a friend currently, so hopefully that will make its way here in the near future.</span>
